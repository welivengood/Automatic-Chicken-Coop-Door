# Arduino Automatic Chicken Coop Door
Welcome to the Arduino Automatic Chicken Coop Door project! This project allows you to control a chicken coop door with a user-friendly interface displayed on an LCD screen and navigated using a keypad. Let's dive into what you'll need and how to set it up.

## Parts Needed
· LCD1602 with IC2 Backpack

· 28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor 

· ULN2003 Driver Board

· DS3231 RTC Module

· 4x4 Matrix Membrane Keypad

## Getting Started
Setting Up the Hardware:
  Connect the LCD, stepper motor with the driver board, RTC module, and keypad to your Arduino board according to the wiring diagram provided in the project documentation.
  
Installing Required Libraries: 
  Download and install the LiquidCrystal IC2 library from [HERE](https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library/tree/master). This library is necessary for using this code, you may be able to find a different LCD library if you wish.
  
Uploading the code:
  Open the Arduino IDE and upload the provided coode to your Arduino board. 
  
Running the Project:
  Once the code is uploaded, you should see the menu displayed on the LCD screen. Use the keypad to navigate through the menu and control the chicken coop door. There is a
  manual for the menu in the project docs.
